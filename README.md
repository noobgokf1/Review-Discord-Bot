The Discord Review Bot is a system that enables users to review each other within Discord servers, with data stored in a SQLite database. This bot allows for rating and reviewing other users, as well as displaying those reviews via a web interface powered by Flask.

- **Web Interface**: View reviews via a live web interface powered by Flask.
- **Search by User or Guild**: Search for reviews based on user IDs or guild names.
- **Real-Time Updates**: New reviews are broadcast to the web interface in real-time via Socket.IO.
- **Bot Integration**: Manage reviews directly within Discord using slash commands.
